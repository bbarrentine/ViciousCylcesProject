            <h2>About Us</h2>
            Vicious Cycles Inc is a Clayton-based cycle workshop founded by a few like-minded individuals in late 2010. Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. Our customer service staff attends to the day to day operations. We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because each and every one of us is a biking enthusiast. 

We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism. We believe in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.
